This report is based off energy estimates for individual components of the SpiNNaker machine. It is not meant to be completely accurate. But does use provenance data gathered from the machine to estimate the energy usage and therefore should be in the right ballpark.


The energy components we use are as follows:

The energy usage for a chip when all cores are 100% active for a millisecond is 0.0006399999999999999 Joules.
The energy usage for a chip when all cores are not active for a millisecond is 0.00036 Joules.
The energy used by the machine for firing a packet is 8e-10 Joules.
The energy used by each active FPGA per millisecond is 0.000584635 Joules.


The packet cost is 0.0942080584000001 Joules
6 FPGAs on the Spalloc-ed boards are turned on and therefore the energy used by the FPGA during the entire time the machine was booted (which was 208035.82599999997 ms) is 492.77797313534995 Joules. The usage during execution was 14.03124 Joules.The amount of time used during the loading process is 35943.76500000001 milliseconds.
Assumed only 2 monitor cores is executing that this point. We also assume that there is a baseline active router/cooling component that is using 5551.397811723494 Joules. Overall the energy usage is 7272.979910150161 Joules.
The amount of time used during the data extraction process is 4969.1320000000005 milliseconds.
Assumed only 2 monitor cores is executing at this point. We also assume that there is a baseline active router/cooling component that is using 766.0590692916561 Joules. Hence the overall energy usage is 8857.598065420312 Joules.
