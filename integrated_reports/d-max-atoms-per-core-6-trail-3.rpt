This report is based off energy estimates for individual components of the SpiNNaker machine. It is not meant to be completely accurate. But does use provenance data gathered from the machine to estimate the energy usage and therefore should be in the right ballpark.


The energy components we use are as follows:

The energy usage for a chip when all cores are 100% active for a millisecond is 0.0006399999999999999 Joules.
The energy usage for a chip when all cores are not active for a millisecond is 0.00036 Joules.
The energy used by the machine for firing a packet is 8e-10 Joules.
The energy used by each active FPGA per millisecond is 0.000584635 Joules.


The packet cost is 0.03228776479999995 Joules
0 FPGAs on the Spalloc-ed boards are turned on and therefore the energy used by the FPGA during the entire time the machine was booted (which was 130217.27199999998 ms) is 0.0 Joules. The usage during execution was 0.0 Joules.The amount of time used during the loading process is 25543.821000000004 milliseconds.
Assumed only 2 monitor cores is executing that this point. We also assume that there is a baseline active router/cooling component that is using 3947.211601373458 Joules. Overall the energy usage is 4359.753670986792 Joules.
The amount of time used during the data extraction process is 4821.194 milliseconds.
Assumed only 2 monitor cores is executing at this point. We also assume that there is a baseline active router/cooling component that is using 743.2524208482521 Joules. Hence the overall energy usage is 5077.691265716546 Joules.
